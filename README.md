Portfolio landing page- This is a school independent project

The portfolio landing page serves to showcase the assignments and projects that I have worked on in Moringa School, and provide some information about myself and why I chose to study software development. The portfolio is a direct indication of what represents Davine as an individual.

The project employs two languages, html and css. All the changes made on the files can be seen through the commits made. An active link of the site can be found on this repository for general viewing.
