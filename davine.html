        Hi! My name Davine Phylis, a creative and soon to be software development.
        I am a Business and Information Technology graduate, with a lot of zeal to learn. Luckily, software development provides the platform. 
        Software development was never in my sights, even while studying a little IT in campus. But as fate would have it, I am here, and I believe there is no mistake.
        I intend to make the most of my journey here. My goal is to learn, adapt and be the best version of a software developer that I can be. Needless to say I am in the right place.
        I believe that Moringa School, with the environment it offers will give me the right environment to be a creative and explore my problem-solving skills through programming.
